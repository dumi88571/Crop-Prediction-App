Crop Prediction & Sustainability Analytics Platform

This project is a comprehensive Flask application that provides crop prediction, yield estimation, sustainability scoring, and data-driven agricultural recommendations. It leverages machine learning to recommend optimal crops, predict yields, assess risks, and generate detailed PDF reports for farmers, agricultural experts, and policymakers.

Features
Crop Recommendation
Suggests the best crops for given environmental conditions using an advanced machine learning model.

Yield Prediction
Estimates the likely yield per hectare based on user input and trained regression models.

Sustainability Scoring
Calculates a multi-factor sustainability score for crop-environment combinations.

Country-Based Crop Recommendations
Offers crop lists tailored for agricultural regions worldwide.

Risk Assessment
Flags risks (climate, disease, nutrients) for each crop and scenario.

Climate Change & Market Price Projections
Simulates future impacts and predicts market prices based on global factors.

Comprehensive PDF Report Generation
Generates downloadable reports summarizing predictions, risks, sustainability, and actionable strategies.

Agricultural Knowledge Base
Provides expert recommendations for irrigation, disease management, companion planting, and precision agriculture.

Robust Error Handling & Logging
Detailed logs and fallback mechanisms for reliable prediction and reporting
